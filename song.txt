[Verse 1]
Let's sing a song, full of hope, full of pain
Why don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain?
Forever young, ever strong, ever brave
Memories like this never end, no, they don't fade away

[Chorus]
So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone
I'll be right there, close to the sun (Close to the sun)
Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
And I'll be right there, close to the sun
Close to the sun
[Drop]
Close to the sun

[Verse 2]
Here's to the one, to let shine, through the rain
The ones who stood for something more, we won't forget your names
The tide is high, say goodbye or set it sail
And all those midnight secrets told, we'll take them to the graves

[Chorus]
So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone
I'll be right there, close to the sun
Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
And I'll be right there, close to the sun
Close to the sun
