[Verse 1]
Let's sing a song, full of hope, full of pain
Why don't you sing along my friend, for it's our last refrain?
Forever young, ever strong, ever brave
Memories like this never end, no, they don't fade away

[Chorus]
So when I'm gone, oh, when I'm gone
I'll be right there, close to the sun (Close to the sun)
Keep holdin' on, keep holdin' on
And I'll be right there, close to the sun
Close to the sun
[Drop]
Close to the sun
